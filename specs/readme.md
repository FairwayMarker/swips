# [⏎](../readme.md) ![Swingby Logo](../logo.png) Swingby Protocol Specifications

> Design documentation for developers. Look here if you are a developer or otherwise technically inclined. 👩🏻‍💻👨🏾‍💻

The protocol specifications are organized into _iterations_ in the following list.
Note that these iterations are not reflected in the directory structure of this repository; we consider all of it to represent one unified platform.
However, the various stages of development will move through these iterations as described in order to execute the [road map](./road-map.md).

This emoji legend is used throughout the SWIPS specifications to indicate the completeness status of various designs.

- 🌕 Completed, released.
- 🌓 In progress, on track.
- 🌑 In progress, planned.
- 🔜 Future plans, to be finalized.

Each specification is given a unique identifier in the format: `SWIPS-<iteration><index 01-99>` to make it easier to refer to them in pull requests, issues and on task boards. Example: `SWIPS-101`.

For finer grained detail about the completion progress of the tasks, follow any of the links below to see a list.
