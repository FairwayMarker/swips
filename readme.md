## What are SWIPs?

SWIPs (Swingby Improvement Proposals) describe standards for Swingby's protocol, including core protocol specifications, node requirements, and contract standards.

Swingby consists of multiple protocols; its most prominent is Skybridge, a cross-chain decentralized bridge to transfer assets between networks.

This repository contains specifications and improvement proposals for Swingby's protocols and other products. Its purpose is to **maintain transparency about the designs and development plans for Swingby** while creating an environment that is conducive to community involvement.
