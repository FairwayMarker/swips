# Swingby Proposals, Specifications, and White Papers

This repository contains specifications and improvement proposals for the various Swingby protocols, products and roadmap.

At its core, Swingby is a set of open protocols driven by feedback from its underlying community. The company that funds development (Swingby Labs Pte. Ltd.) has created a blueprint that it believes represents the _optimal critical path_ to achieving the project's goals of implementing the fastest and widest-supported cross-chain bridges for DeFi.

Hence, it is important that the project leverages external input to make this happen.

The purpose of this repository is to **maintain transparency about the designs and development plans for the protocols** while creating an environment that is conducive to community involvement.
